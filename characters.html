    <div>
    <h2>Abdul Haqq Walid</h2>
    <p>Doctor Abdul Haqq Walid is a red headed Scottsman and the Folly’s medical expert. He has been aware of magic and working with Nightingale for ten years at the start of the series.  </p>
    <h2>Abigail Kamara </h2>
    <p>Abigail is Peter’s younger cousin. She first appears in book 2, Moon Over Soho, where she asks Peter if magic is real and extracts a promise from him that if she passes her Latin GCSE at A level he will teach her. Nightingale forbids Peter to teach her but says he will teach her himself if it comes to it. As of book 8, False Value,  Abigail is learning magical notation. </p>
    <h2>Beverley Brook</h2>
    <p>Daughter of Mama Thames Beverly Brook is a classic middle child in a lot of ways. She’s both rebellious and overachieving. She both passively and actively pursues Peter. </p>
    <h2>The Faceless Man</h2>
    <p>A villain that is both easy to hate and like The Faceless Man has a nerdy sense of humor and a deep love of all things Romano-Brit to the point of racism. </p>
    <h2>Father Thames</h2>
    <p>Father Thames is the God of the River but only above Teddington Lock. He was the God of the entirety of the Thames until some point after he abandoned London in 1858, during The Great Stink. He is described as having a roman nose and heavy brows. He most often is dressed as a traveling showman and this is part of how his camp at the source of the river blends in.</p>
    <h2>Lesley May</h2>
    <p>Ambitious to a fault Lesley May is Peter’s counterpart. When Peter is distracted Lesley is focused, where Peter is adequate Lesley is perfect. Lesley is one character people either love or hate. 
Lesley and Peter went through Hendon together and became fast friends even though they are very different people. Lesley is regarded as the best of her generation but events in book 1, Midnight Riot in the USA, Rivers of London everywhere else, lead her down a different path. No matter how you feel about Lesley it’s clear she’s not done yet. </p>
    <h2>Mama Thames</h2>
    <p>Mama Thames is the Goddess of the River below Teddington Lock, it is said her power comes from the tides and the ports. She is a Nigerian woman who came to London in 1957 to train as a nurse. After her lover dumped her she decided to commit suicide. The river called to her and offered her a trade, her life in exchange for power and the responsibility of care of the river. So splash. </p>
    <h2>Molly</h2>
    <p>Little is known about Molly. Dressed in an Edwardian maids uniform, with too pointy of teeth, and looking almost Asian but not quite Molly is “indispensable” and “does” for the Folly according to DCI Nightingale</p>
    <h2>Peter Grant</h2>
    <p>Peter Grant is everyone’s favorite easily distracted hero. The son of an English man and a woman from Sierra Leone Peter is passionate about architecture but terrible at drawing as a result he ended up joining the London Metropolitan Police instead. We meet Peter as he is finishing up his two year probation and shortly before he is assigned to ES19 (Economic and Specialist Crimes). 
      Peter is frequently referred to as The Starling but as of book 8, False Value, we don’t have any information about what that refers to outside of a comment from Huge Oswald in book 5, Foxglove Summer. </p>
    <h2>Harold Postmartin</h2>
    <p>Postmartin the pirate is definitely a man you should keep your eyes on. If you don’t, he’ll snatch any he thinks belongs in the Folly’s archives and take it back to Oxford with him.</p>
    <h2>Mr Punch</h2>
    <p>Mr. Punch - whether he is a God on the Spirit of Riot and Rebellion there is more to Mr. Punch than meets the eye, especially since you can’t see him.</p>
    <h2>Sahra Guleed</h2>
    <p>Sahra Guleed, often called the Somally Ninja or Somally Ninja Girl, is a member of the murder squad. She is one of Seawoll’s favorites and is one of the most Falcon capable officers.</p>
    <h2>DCI Alexander Seawoll</h2>
    <p>Alexander Seawoll is a big man and 100% the type who enjoys being intimidating. He is a DCI and the head of the murder squad with a soft spot for smart, ambitious, determined, and terrifying women whom he hires and mentors before personally escorting them up the chain of command. </p>
    <h2>DCI Thomas Nightingale</h2>
    <p>Voted most eligible bachelor in London 30 years in a row Detective Chief Inspector. Thomas Nightingale is not what he appears. What he appears to be is a well heeled and fashionable gentleman in his bluff mid 40’s who might be looking for a young and slightly ethnic boyfriend. What he really is the last and well he might be aging backward. Either way he’s definitely a catch so set your cup at him; If you aren’t afraid of Molly that is.</p>
