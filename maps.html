    <h1 class="p1">MAPS</h1> 
   
    <p>This is a collection of put together by fan of the Rivers of London series. I don’t have any affiliation with these maps but I felt they were worth collecting because they help give a nice sense of space to the series. As a fan from America even though I’ve been in London I’m not familiar enough with the neighborhoods to have a good understanding of how close things are to one another. In addition, when Peter leaves London or talks about places outside of the capital I usually don’t even know which direction he is traveling. These maps have helped me have a better understanding of England.</p>  
    
    <p>I believe that exploring the very real elements of the world that Peter, and Aaronovitch, live in helps bring a depth of understanding to the story, the author, and to Peter. Peter is deeply in love with London and spends most of his time there. Seeing the concentration of events in his life that take place with a few square miles helps put the reader into Peter’s mind and point of view. </p> 
    <p>As Aaronovitch has expanded the series beyond not just London but England itself it is important to start making connections in other countries as well. I think this may be particularly important if we want to have an in-depth understanding of where Agent Reynolds' part of the story is headed. Since the Librarians and the Library have been added to our knowledge of America our view of the magic in the world have expanded.</p>  
    
    <p>As you navigate around the web please feel free to submit new maps you might either run across or make.</p>
